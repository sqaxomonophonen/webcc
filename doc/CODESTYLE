Golden rule: it should be easy to port/diff code between chibicc and webcc
unless there's a really good reason to break this rule.

For that reason the code style is just:
 - Tab is 2 spaces

Also: since I find it low-key valuable to be able to tell where code came from
just by glancing at it I mix in my personal style for new and heavily modified
code:
 - `int* foo` instead of `int *foo`
 - `void fn(void)\n{` instead of `void fn(void) {`
 - inconsistent spacing, e.g. between operators
 - `struct foo` instead of `typedef struct foo Foo` (XXX unsure about this one)

Never bulk update the style. NEVER run an automated linter.
