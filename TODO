 - codegen.c => WASM!

 - optimizations?
   - surprise: chibicc doesn't do constant folding? i.e. `return 10*20;` will
     generate code that multiplies 10 with 20. this is surprising because
     `int xs[10*20];` actually works properly; it calculates the size of xs[]
     at compile-time. see also: test/constexpr.c
   - switch/case? analyse cases and choose a strategy? like: simple if/else;
     jump tables; binary search if/else? the self-hosted compiler could benefit
     from this.
